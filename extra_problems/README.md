## 🔢 range_sum_query.cc

- 💡 This problem is a great example of using prefix sums to answer range queries in O(1) time.
- 🚀 The idea is to precompute the prefix sums of the array, so that when a range query is made, we can answer it in O(1) time by subtracting the prefix sum at the start of the range from the prefix sum at the end of the range.
